# BadSheep

Video player explicitly made to play [Bad Apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8) on a screen entirely made out of sheep.
This was made with the help of [JCodec](https://github.com/jcodec/jcodec), and a few other common libraries.

This plugin has no permission nodes or anything of the sort and is not intended to be used in production servers. 
Further development needed.

### Requirements
